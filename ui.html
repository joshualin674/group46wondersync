      <h2>Splash Page</h2>
      <p>The splash page UI starts the users off in the application, providing users with a brief introduction to the app through showcasing the logo and tagline before giving the users the option to start or exit the app. When starting, it’ll navigate the user smoothly to the next screen.</p>

      <h2>Login Page</h2>
      <p>In the next screen, the app leads to a login page. This provides two functionalities: logging in and account creation. The user is prompted to enter their email and password, clearly labeled and with support validation to ensure correct formatting is used. The users can then log in with the button after, leading to the home page of the app. Otherwise, users can create an account, which will also prompt for an email and password to register with. Both pages are clean and minimalistic, allowing the user to clearly know what to do. The login and create account pages are similar to provide a seamless flow for choosing either option.</p>

      <h2>Home Screen - Logistics</h2>
      <p>Our home screen is the logistics screen. Each page has a clear title at the top to ensure users have clarity on each page they’re on. The logistics screen shows 3 buttons, each clearly labeled with their functionality. When creating the pie chart, it smoothly moves down the two other buttons to allow space for the chart. The other two buttons allow the user to add contributors to their trip and notes, which every contributor is able to add and view.</p>

      <h2>Destinations</h2>
      <p>The bottom of the app shows a clear navigation bar that allows the user to navigate to the other screens: Destinations, Dining Establishments, Accommodations, and Travel Community. The Destinations screen allows the users to input each destination they plan on going, as well as calculating the time. After adding the destinations, the app displays a list of each one in a clear format, accurately placing them in order.</p>

      <h2>Dining Reservations Screen</h2>
      <p>The Dining Reservation screen shows the upcoming and past reservations made by the user through clear buttons they can click to switch between pages. Reservations are shown as individual items with the name, time, and website of the reservation. The large and colored button in the bottom right is similar across all pages, allowing users to easily add reservations to this page.</p>

      <h2>Accommodations Screen</h2>
      <p>The accommodations page is similar, with the add button allowing users to input their planned accommodations for their trip. There are two buttons allowing users to choose how they’d like to sort their accommodations. Each accommodation has clear text showing the name and when it is.</p>

      <h2>Travel Community Screen</h2>
      <p>The travel community screen allows users to connect with other users on the app. Users can create a new post detailing their travel as well as notes with the add button. They can also see other users’ posts on the page, with each detail of the trip clearly labeled and bolded to easily read and understand while scrolling.</p>
