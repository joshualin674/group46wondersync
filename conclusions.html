        WanderSync served as an impactful experience for us to learn the nuances of Android development while practicing real-life software design and engineering principles. Each team member contributed to the codebase during the four sprints, culminating in a product with a well-developed frontend and backend. All team members gained insights into crucial aspects of software engineering, including technical details such as design patterns and intangible concepts such as Agile project management.

        We faced several challenges over the course of WanderSync’s development. Using a Version Control System (Git), managing roles and sprint timing, and learning syntax/documentation for Android on the fly were some of our biggest obstacles. However, thanks to each teammate’s willingness to help and the collaborative nature of the project’s development, we managed to overcome these roadblocks and complete our goals.

        Thanks to WanderSync, each of us will walk away with a greater understanding of software development principles in the real world, and especially with regard to Android app development. Tools like Android Studio, cloud services like Firebase, project management concepts like Scrum, and design patterns such as SOLID/GRASP are just a few of the countless concepts we’ve learned and will continue to use in our engineering careers. WanderSync has been an enlightening experience for all of us and we can’t wait to see what else is in store.
